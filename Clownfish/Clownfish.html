        <h2>Clownfish Habitat</h2>
        <p>False clownfish live in the coral reefs off the coasts of Australia and Southeast Asia as far north as southern Japan. They are found mainly around certain kinds of anemones, a creature that anchors itself to the sea floor and uses its tentacles to attract food. The anemone's tentacles have stinging cells called nematocysts that release a toxin when prey or predator touches it.</p> 
        <p>Clownfish, however, develop immunity to the toxin by very carefully touching the tentacles with different parts of their bodies, according to <em>National Geographic</em>. A layer of mucus builds up, protecting the clownfish from the toxin. The pair forms a symbiotic relationship. The anemone provides protection and leftovers for the clownfish, while the clownfish brings food to the anemone and preens its host, removing parasites.</p> 
        

        <h2>Clownfish Behavior</h2>

        <p>All anemonefish, including clownfish, are hermaphrodites. They are all born male, according to National Geographic. They have the ability to turn themselves female, but once the change is made, they canâ€™t go back to being male. Sometimes the change is made when mating. Two males will become mates and the larger, dominant fish will become the female.</p>
        <p>These social fish live in groups that are led by one dominant female, The second largest fish is the dominant male while all of the other fish in the group are smaller males. If the female dies, the dominant male will become a female to replace her. The largest of the smaller males will then become the dominant male of the group.</p>
        <p>Clownfish communicate by making popping and clicking noise as well as a shaking the less domate will show to the more domate memebr to show submissivness. This helps maintain the rank and file among group members.</p>
